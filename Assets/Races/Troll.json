They are often solitary creatures, living in caves or ruins, and are feared by most other beings for their strength, resilience, and appetite. Trolls have thick, rubbery skin and long limbs, making them formidable in combat. Despite their brutish nature, trolls can sometimes be bargained with, provided one has something valuable to offer.",
