    "description": "Bugbears are hulking goblinoids with a penchant for violence and a love for cruelty. They are known for their brute strength and ability to move quietly despite their size. Bugbears are often found in the service of other goblinoids, but they can also act as bandits, mercenaries, and lone predators. Their physical appearance is terrifying, with their muscular build, long arms, and thick fur that covers their bodies.",
