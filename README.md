# THIS IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

# D&D Powershell Character Creator
A Powershell script that is used to make a character in D&D, it uses the windows forms and asks various questions to which by the end will auto-generate a character sheet PDF ready for usage / printing, the post saved file can still be edited accordingly. I will also put in that the JSON files are editable and be altered to fit any story you create, with this you may also edit the powershell script provided from this, there is an EXE available for those who do not wish to edit.

I have purchased a lot of material from D&D to get this script made, I have all the current manuals and majority of the cards to just get the right bits of information to make this all work, I will however do not want to make money off this, so please if you do use this, DO NOT SELL.

Although you may donate to me as I will be outputting all kinds of powershell scripts, from home to corporate use: https://paypal.me/SparksSkywere?locale.x=en_GB
