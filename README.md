# D&D Powershell Character Creator
A Powershell script that is used to make a character in D&amp;D, it uses the windows forms and asks various questions to which by the end will auto-generate a character sheet.

This powershell script follows 5E books, the website to get a better understanding is:

I have purchased a lot of material from D&D to get this script made, from monster manuals to a lot of cards to just get the right bits of information to make this all work, I will however do not want to make money off this as the D&D property is not owned by me, this is merely a fan project.

Thank you to Microsoft for making this possible as I did not know much in the coding space and working with powershell has opened a lot of doors for me, this is a project of many using powershell but this is my largest and most complex of all scripts.
