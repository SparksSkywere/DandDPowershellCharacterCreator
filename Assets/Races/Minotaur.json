    "description": "A minotaur's roar is a savage battle cry that most civilized creatures fear. Born into the mortal realm by the demonic rites, minotaurs are savage conquerors and carnivores that live for the hunt. Their brown and black fur is stained with the blood of fallen foes and they carry the stench of death.",

    "special": "Charge. If the minotaur moves at least 10 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone. Labyrinthine Recall. The minotaur can perfectly recall any path it has travelled. Reckless. At the start of it's turn, the minotaur can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of it's next turn.",
