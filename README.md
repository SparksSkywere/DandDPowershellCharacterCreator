# THIS IS IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

# D&D Powershell Character Creator
A Powershell script that is used to make a character in D&D, it uses the windows forms and asks various questions to which by the end will auto-generate a character sheet PDF ready for usage / printing, the post saved file can still be edited accordingly. I will also put in that the JSON files are editable and be altered to fit any story you create, with this you may also edit the powershell script provided from this, there is an EXE available for those who do not wish to edit.

I have aquired a lot of official material from Wizards of the Coast to get this script accurate, I have all the current 5E books and cards, I will however do not want to make money off this.

# How to use
1. When using this program what you will need to do is either run the exe (no admin needed)
2. Right click the PS1 file and "run in powershell"
3. Type into powershell ".\DnDCharacterCreator.ps1" within the directory of the git download
